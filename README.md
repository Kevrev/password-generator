# Password Generator

## Description

This project was created to showcase knowledge of JavaScript by creating a password generator that generates a random password based on user-chosen parameters including: lengths from 8 - 128, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Usage

The initial generate function drops the options menu which allows the user to select their desired parameters for their generated password. Clicking generate after this intial step will generate a password. Clicking generate again will generate a new one.

Note: At least one option must be selected for generation to occur.

Note 2: Due to the nature of the password generation (generating larger than desired size, shuffling it, then slicing it), there is a rare chance that one of the desired parameters will not appear in a password. This can be remidied by modifying the password manually, generating a new one, or increasing the desired length. Again, this is fairly rare.

## Credits

FlorinPop17 for their password generator [walkthrough](https://codepen.io/FlorinPop17/pen/BaBePej). It provided a good reference point for how exactly a password generator could work and was a good foundation to refer back to when stuck. My random generation function for grabbing characters from a string ultimately ended up being the same.

Tutorials Point for their [Fisher-Yates shuffle tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-fisher-yates-shuffle-in-javascript). Their explanation of the concept and tutorial were instrumental for implementing the password scramble into the password generator.
